The whole assembly was too large for the file size limit here, so for now I have to make do with a [download link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16oUMGvnlRqHtTNbWmS9C6yU7JHYZHUGY/view?usp=sharing)
Beware! this file takes several **minutes** to open, I suggest hiding in particular the electronics unless you're actively working on them, as they're pretty resource-intensive.

There's also a FreeCAD bug preventing me from exporting some STEP assemblies, so I'll add a STEP version of this whole printer ASAP!
