## A cool-looking, low-cost, modern(ish) bedslinger 3D printer that can be built using parts from an older I3-style machine

Just the CAD files for now; I'll add the other stuff (STLs for printable parts, drawings and DXFs for the base, etc.) as I go.\
Download the [FreeCAD file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16oUMGvnlRqHtTNbWmS9C6yU7JHYZHUGY/view?usp=sharing) or [STEP assembly](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rc-gUZN0Lh5QLSH7OIJOY7BAhNWv18Eq/view?usp=sharing)

Note: many of the off-the-shelf components in this model (like the PSU, controller board, filament spool, etc.) I obviously didn't recreate in CAD myself; they're all downloaded from GrabCAD. No idea what the license situation is like over there, so maybe consider this license here valid only for the overall printer design and the parts I modeled personally, not the third-party assets.\
Also, this printer obviously makes use of the [Voron StealthBurner](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Stealthburner/tree/main) printhead and was overall heavily designed after its style.
The parts I modified for clearances are the only ones I'll share seperately from the main assembly here; everything else you can download over there.
