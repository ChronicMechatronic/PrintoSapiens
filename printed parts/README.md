All 3D printed parts neded to build this printer, including required drill guides.

I adopted the Voron file naming scheme to differentiate between primary and accent color, so in case of doubt please refer to their manual. In a nutshell there's just the letter "a" in square brackets at the beginning of each file name to indicate the part is printed in accent color: [a]
